This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Natural Language Processing Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892?gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP6ABhCjARIsAH37rbRPo6FqHI8nkwemL5ip5K-wvRDIHSGQvrV1ombJTqYxw8kNO8ff_S8aAhlMEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=8301633102_c&utm_keyword=udacity%20nlp%20nanodegree_e&utm_medium=ads_n&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_term=85164908283) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various NLP topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as speech tagging model, machine translation model using recurrent neural network architectures. There are other topics covered such as speech recognition model using deep neural networks.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.




## Projects :
#### [Project -1  Part of Speech Tagging](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/NLP-Nandodegree/blob/master/Program-projects/P1-%202-Project-HMMPartOfSpeechTagging/HMM%20warmup%20(optional).ipynb) 
- **Summary:** Use several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and hidden Markov models, to tag parts of speech in sentences, and compare their performance.

#### [Project -2 Machine Translation](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/NLP-Nandodegree/blob/master/Program-projects/P2-MachineTranslation/machine_translation.ipynb) 
- **Summary:** Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. Youâ€™ll be able to explore several recurrent neural network architectures and compare their performance.


#### [Project -3Speech Recognizer](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/NLP-Nandodegree/blob/master/Program-projects/P3-DNN%20Speech%20Recognizer/machine_translation.ipynb) 
- **Summary:** Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The model will convert raw audio into feature representations, which will then turn them into transcribed text.
