This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892?gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP6ABhCjARIsAH37rbRPo6FqHI8nkwemL5ip5K-wvRDIHSGQvrV1ombJTqYxw8kNO8ff_S8aAhlMEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=8301633102_c&utm_keyword=udacity%20nlp%20nanodegree_e&utm_medium=ads_n&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_term=85164908283) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight intialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.


## Core Curriculum:

#### 1- Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Neural networks is the Bedrock to Deep learning . we'll learn how it works and test our ability by Building Neural Network from Sctratch.
- **Keywords:** Logistic Regression ,Multilayer Perceptrons , Gradient Descent , Backpropagation.

#### 2- Convolutional Neural Networks 
- **Summary:** Convolutional neural networks is the standrad for solving Computer Vision Problems. it's used in Self-Driving cars ,face recognation and Medical imaging . we'll learn how to build and train ConvNet using TensorFlow and using regularization technique like TensorFlow Dropout for reducing overfitting and apply that to image classification Problem.  
- **Keywords:** ConvNet,Tensorflow , Tensorflow Dropout , K Fold Cross Validation , Deep Neural Networks.

#### 3- Recurrent Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Recurrent Neural Networks are able to learn from sequences of data . RNNs also work great as feature extractors for text which you can use for things like sentiment analysis. Youâ€™ll use recurrent networks to generate new text and translate from one language to another. In this section we'll learn the concept behind RNNs and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning to train an AI agent by giving it rewards for performing correct actions.  
- **Keywords:** RNNs,Hyperparameters,Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Word Embeddings, Word2Vec,TensorBoard.

#### 4- Generative Adversarial Networks 
- **Summary:** Generative adversarial networks (GANS) pit two neural networks in competition, allowing these networks to model reality with amazing accuracy. Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, will show you how these fascinating models work and how to build them.
- **Keywords:** GANs.
